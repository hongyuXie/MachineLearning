![改进一个机器学习系统的性能几种方案](amWiki/images/001/06-Week6/1-Advice for Applying Machine Learning/1-改进一个机器学习系统的性能几种方案.jpg)  
到目前为止 我们已经介绍了许多不同的学习算法 如果你一直跟着这些视频的进度学习 你会发现自己已经不知不觉地 成为一个了解许多先进机器学习技术的专家了 然而 在懂机器学习的人当中 依然存在着很大的差距 一部分人确实掌握了 怎样高效有力地 运用这些学习算法 而另一些人 他们可能对我马上要讲的东西 就不是那么熟悉了 他们可能没有完全理解 怎样运用这些算法 因此总是 把时间浪费在 毫无意义的尝试上 我想做的是 确保你在设计 机器学习的系统时 你能够明白怎样选择 一条最合适 最正确的道路 因此 在这节视频 和之后的几段视频中 我将向你介绍一些实用的 建议和指导 帮助你明白怎样进行选择 具体来讲 我将重点关注的问题是 假如你在开发 一个机器学习系统 或者想试着改进 一个机器学习系统的性能 你应如何决定 接下来应该 选择哪条道路？为了解释这一问题 我想仍然使用 预测房价的学习例子 假如你已经完成了正则化线性回归 也就是最小化代价函数J的值 假如 在你得到你的学习参数以后 如果你要将你的假设函数 放到一组新的房屋样本上进行测试 假如说你发现在预测房价时 产生了巨大的误差 现在你的问题是 要想改进这个算法 接下来应该怎么办？实际上你可以想出 很多种方法来改进 这个算法的性能 其中一种办法是 使用更多的训练样本 具体来讲 也许你能想到 通过电话调查 或上门调查 来获取更多的 不同的房屋出售数据 遗憾的是 我看到好多人花费了好多时间 想收集更多的训练样本 他们总认为 噢 要是我有 两倍甚至十倍数量的训练数据 那就一定会解决问题的 是吧？ 但有时候 获得更多的训练数据 实际上并没有作用 在接下来的几段视频中 我们将解释原因 我们也将知道 怎样避免把过多的时间 浪费在收集更多的训练数据上 这实际上是于事无补的 另一个方法 你也许能想到的 是尝试选用更少的特征集 因此如果你有一系列特征 比如x1 x2 x3等等 也许有很多特征 也许你可以花一点时间 从这些特征中 仔细挑选一小部分来防止过拟合 或者也许你需要用更多的特征 也许目前的特征集 对你来讲并不是很有帮助 你希望从获取更多特征的角度 来收集更多的数据 同样地 你可以把这个问题 扩展为一个很大的项目 比如使用电话调查 来获得更多有关 或者再进行土地测量 来获得更多有关 这块土地的信息等等 因此这是一个复杂的问题 同样的道理 我们非常希望 在花费大量时间完成这些工作之前 我们就能知道其效果如何 我们也可以尝试 增加多项式特征的方法 比如x1的平方 x2的平方 x1 x2的乘积 我们可以花很多时间 来考虑这一方法 我们也可以考虑其他方法 减小或增大正则化参数lambda的值 我们列出的这个单子 上面的很多方法 都可以扩展开来 扩展成一个六个月或更长时间的项目 遗憾的是 大多数人用来选择这些方法的标准 是凭感觉的 也就是说 大多数人的选择方法是 随便从这些方法中选择一种 比如他们会说 “噢 我们来多找点数据吧” 然后花上六个月的时间 收集了一大堆数据 然后也许另一个人说 “好吧 让我们来从这些房子的数据中多找点特征吧” 我很遗憾不止一次地看到 很多人花了 不夸张地说 至少六个月时间 来完成他们随便选择的一种方法 而在六个月或者更长时间后 他们很遗憾地发现 自己选择的是一条不归路 幸运的是 有一系列简单的方法 能让你事半功倍 排除掉单子上的 至少一半的方法 留下那些确实有前途的方法 同时也有一种很简单的方法 只要你使用 就能很轻松地排除掉很多选择 从而为你节省 大量不必要花费的时间 在接下来的两段视频中 我首先介绍 怎样评估机器学习算法的性能 然后在之后的几段视频中 我将开始 讨论这些方法 它们也被称为"机器学习诊断法"

“诊断法”的意思是 这是一种测试法 你通过执行这种测试 能够深入了解 某种算法到底是否有用 这通常也能够告诉你 要想改进一种算法的效果 什么样的尝试才是有意义的 在这一系列的视频中我们将介绍具体的诊断法 但我要提前说明一点的是 这些诊断法的执行和实现 是需要花些时间的 有时候 确实需要花很多时间 来理解和实现 但这样做的确是 更有效率地利用好你的时间 因为这些方法 让你在开发学习算法时 节省了几个月的时间 早点从不必要的尝试中解脱出来 早日脱离苦海 因此 在接下来几节课中 我将先来介绍 如何评价你的学习算法 在此之后 我将介绍一些诊断法 希望能让你更清楚 在接下来的尝试中 如何选择更有意义的方法 最终达到改进机器学习系统性能的目的

### Several methods to improve the performance of a machine learning system
![Several methods to improve the performance of a machine learning system](amWiki/images/001/06-Week6/1-Advice for Applying Machine Learning/1-改进一个机器学习系统的性能几种方案.jpg)
By now you have seen a lot of different learning algorithms.And if you've been following along these videos you should consider yourself an expert on many state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. But even among people that know a certain learning algorithm. There's often a huge difference between someone that really knows how to powerfully and effectively apply that algorithm, versus someone that's less familiar with some of the material that I'm about to teach and who doesn't really understand how to apply these algorithms and can end up wasting a lot of their time trying things out that don't really make sense.What I would like to do is make sure that if you are developing machine learning systems, that you know how to choose one of the most promising avenues to spend your time pursuing. And on this and the next few videos I'm going to give a number of practical suggestions, advice, guidelines on how to do that. And concretely what we'd focus on is the problem of, suppose you are developing a machine learning system or trying to improve the performance of a machine learning system, how do you go about deciding what are the proxy avenues to try next?To explain this, let's continue using our example of learning to predict housing prices. And let's say you've implement and regularize linear regression. Thus minimizing that cost function j. Now suppose that after you take your learn parameters, if you test your hypothesis on the new set of houses, suppose you find that this is making huge errors in this prediction of the housing prices.The question is what should you then try mixing in order to improve the learning algorithm?There are many things that one can think of that could improve the performance of the learning algorithm.One thing they could try, is to get more training examples. And concretely, you can imagine, maybe, you know, setting up phone surveys, going door to door, to try to get more data on how much different houses sell for.And the sad thing is I've seen a lot of people spend a lot of time collecting more training examples, thinking oh, if we have twice as much or ten times as much training data, that is certainly going to help, right? But sometimes getting more training data doesn't actually help and in the next few videos we will see why, and we will see how you can avoid spending a lot of time collecting more training data in settings where it is just not going to help.Other things you might try are to well maybe try a smaller set of features. So if you have some set of features such as x1, x2, x3 and so on, maybe a large number of features. Maybe you want to spend time carefully selecting some small subset of them to prevent overfitting.Or maybe you need to get additional features. Maybe the current set of features aren't informative enough and you want to collect more data in the sense of getting more features.And once again this is the sort of project that can scale up the huge projects can you imagine getting phone surveys to find out more houses, or extra land surveys to find out more about the pieces of land and so on, so a huge project. And once again it would be nice to know in advance if this is going to help before we spend a lot of time doing something like this. We can also try adding polynomial features things like x2 square x2 square and product features x1, x2. We can still spend quite a lot of time thinking about that and we can also try other things like decreasing lambda, the regularization parameter or increasing lambda.Given a menu of options like these, some of which can easily scale up to six month or longer projects.Unfortunately, the most common method that people use to pick one of these is to go by gut feeling. In which what many people will do is sort of randomly pick one of these options and maybe say, "Oh, lets go and get more training data." And easily spend six months collecting more training data or maybe someone else would rather be saying, "Well, let's go collect a lot more features on these houses in our data set." And I have a lot of times, sadly seen people spend, you know, literally 6 months doing one of these avenues that they have sort of at random only to discover six months later that that really wasn't a promising avenue to pursue.Fortunately, there is a pretty simple technique that can let you very quickly rule out half of the things on this list as being potentially promising things to pursue. And there is a very simple technique, that if you run, can easily rule out many of these options,and potentially save you a lot of time pursuing something that's just is not going to work.In the next two videos after this, I'm going to first talk about how to evaluate learning algorithms.And in the next few videos after that, I'm going to talk about these techniques,which are called the machine learning diagnostics.
### Machine learning diagnostics definition and effects
![Machine learning diagnostics definition and effects](amWiki/images/001/06-Week6/1-Advice for Applying Machine Learning/2-机器学习诊断法定义以及作用.jpg)
And what a diagnostic is, is a test you can run, to get insight into what is or isn't working with an algorithm, and which will often give you insight as to what are promising things to try to improve a learning algorithm's performance. We'll talk about specific diagnostics later in this video sequence. But I should mention in advance that diagnostics can take time to implement and can sometimes, you know, take quite a lot of time to implement and understand but doing so can be a very good use of your time when you are developing learning algorithms because they can often save you from spending many months pursuing an avenue that you could have found out much earlier just was not going to be fruitful.So in the next few videos, I'm going to first talk about how evaluate your learning algorithms and after that I'm going to talk about some of these diagnostics which will hopefully let you much more effectively select more of the useful things to try mixing if your goal to improve the machine learning system.
